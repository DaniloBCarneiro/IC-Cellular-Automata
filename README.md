Project name: "Implementation of a Traffic Simulator Model using Celular Automata"

Original title: "Implementação de um modelo de simulação de tráfego rodoviário usando Cellular Automata"

Abstract:
  Models of traffic simulation have become a very useful tool for planning, design and operation of Transportation Systems. The biggest advantage they offer is it's capacity to evaluate alternatives even before it's implementation and investigate conditions that would be difficult to observe in the real world, without the necessity of submiting the users of the system to inconvenient tests. However, the use of simulation requires proper calibration of the models, assuring an adequate representation of real traffic stream. Regarding this aspect, the recently developed CA or "Cellular Automata" models, simple and flexible, offer a great range of information about traffic behaviour with minimum computational efford and allow for great scale simulation implementations. The present work aims to calibrate a simple TCA (Traffic Cellular Automata) microscopic model using real data from the freeways of São Paulo and compare it's results to other already established macroscopic models (Greenshields, Pipes and Van Aerde).
